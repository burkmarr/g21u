# TODO
- Various
  - It is possible to lose edits by clicking on another record to look for a value, e.g. location, before saving. Should software prevent changing record when there are edits either unsaved or un-cancelled?
  - A short-cut key to copy field value from previous record would be really useful, particularly for location.
  - A way to zip files before sharing? Would overcome problem with browser limit.
  - I think that tab key would work on datalist if it wasn't captured and cancelled. Is there a way to still use it?
  - Using browser back button causes incorrect menu button highlighting.
- Testing
  - Need to check how everything works without internet.
  - Need to test that everything works with the different file handling options.
  - Revisit map resizing - very hard to get the resize handle on mobile.
  - Need to test on iPhone.
- Documentation
  - Document lack of sharing in Firefox.
