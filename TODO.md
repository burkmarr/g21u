# TODO

- Progress bar
  - CSV merge?

- Mapping
  - Add a link to Bing maps showing OS map - to help people get location name, e.g. https://www.bing.com/maps?cp=53.581888%7E-2.653974&lvl=15.1&style=s

- Navigation
  - Shift tab to go to the next 'not recorded' (and other similar default?) - values and select whole value
  - When taxon drop-down is shown, tab should take to the next entry and enter should select

- Testing
  - Need to check how everything works without internet.
  - Need to test that everything works with the different file handling options.
  - Revisit map resizing - very hard to get the resize handle on mobile.
  - Need to test on iPhone.
