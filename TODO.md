  - Dialogs for delete record, delete sound, delete CSV and merge CSV should have checkbox if archive folder valid to indicate whether to move or delete files
- GUI considerations
  - Could/should play sound and duplicate button go on middle toobar?
  - Or maybe sound should recieve foucus?
  - Look at how focus moves on record details -  make record entry as efficient as possible. 
  - Next should get focus when save button used.
- Testing
  - Need to check how everything works without internet.
  - Need to test that everything works with the different file handling options.
  - Revisit map resizing - very hard to get the resize handle on mobile.
