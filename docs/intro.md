## Introduction to g21u

Gilbert 21 Universal (g21u) is a web-based application.
That means you can run it entirely from the browser, just by
entering the URL (https://burkmarr.github.io/g21u) in
your browser's addres bar. No extra software or installation
is required. 

However, it is also a 
*Progressive Web Application* (PWA), which means that on many platforms you can 'install' it which puts an
icon on your home screen just like a conventionally 
installed app.
When started via this icon, it looks bit different than when
run in a browser - you don't see the normal browser
decorations such as the address bar or navigation buttons,
but under the hood it still runs in the browser you installed
it from.

Because it is a PWA, 
it will cache all the vital files it needs when you first load it in your browser. Consequently it will run even 
when you have no WiFi or data connection, so you can use it in the field without the internet. 
(Some features do require the internet, but these
are not those you typically use in the field.)

*g21u* replaces two previous pieces of software - the
Gilbert 21 Android app and the Gilbert 21
desktop application (a VB.net application).
