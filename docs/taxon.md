The taxon details panel is then displayed by tapping the taxon button (shown on the far right).

The taxon panel shows some details for the taxon of the record currently selected in the record summary panel (i.e. the one highlighted in yellow). The details are all derived from the [NBN *species lookup with GUID* API (https://species-ws.nbnatlas.org/species/{guid})](https://api.nbnatlas.org/).

Information on the taxonomy of the recorded taxon is presented togeather with a list of common names and synonyms. Alongside the taxonomic information, is a count (*NBN count*) showing how many observation records the NBN has for this taxon. This can be a useful indication of how common or rare the taxon is.

This panel is for information only and cannot be used to edit a record. The informaation it displays is not stored with the record - it is retrieved *on the fly* from the NBN API.
