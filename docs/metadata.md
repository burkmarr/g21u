If the metadata panel is not already displayed, you can display it clicking on the metadata button (shown on the far right).

The metadata panel is then displayed by tapping the metadata button (shown on the far right).

The metadata panel shows the following metadata for a record:
- the original recording details including
  - the original filename for the voice recording,
  - the date and time the record was made,
  - the original location recorded by your device for the record (either grid reference or lat/lon depeted on your select [Options](/help.html?page=options)),
  - the accuracy for the location recorded by your device and
  - the altitude recorded by your devide;
- the date and time of any downloads you have performed on the record;
- the date and time of any shares you have performed on the record; and
- the date and time of any exports to CSVs you have performed on the record.

All of this information is recorded in the text file associated with a record but none of it is exported when records are exported to CSV files (except where that information is part of a record field, such as date or location).
