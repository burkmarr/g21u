# The record summary panel

[Help index](/help.html?page=index)

<img src="/docs/images/nav-list.png" style="float: right; width: 40px; margin: 10px" />The record summary panel can be reached by tapping the list icon on the bottom navigation bar. The panel lists all the records you currently have within scope (i.e. those that are held in the device's storage as specified in the [options](/help.html?page=options)).

## Record summary display

When a record is newly minted, it looks something like this in the record list:

It has the date & time and the location at which the sound file was created. The location is expressed as an OS grid reference or a latitude and longitude pair depending on your selection in the  [options](/help.html?page=options).

When you have edited the record and added a taxon's scientific name, this will also be shown in the record list as shown here:

When you are managing records (normally on the desktop) and download, share or export a record to CSV, then the record in the record summary list is marked with an icon to show that the operation has been performed on the record. For example, the following record is marked to show that it has been downloaded, shared and exported to CSV. (In reality you are only likely to perform one or two of these operations on any one record.)
