# Navigating the record details panels

[Help index](/help.html?page=index)

When navigating the app, you will notice differences when the app is displayed on a large screen device such as a laptop or desktop computer (just referred to here as desktop for brevity) and a small screen device such as a smartphone (referred to here as mobile). This page highlights the different ways of navigating the various panels of the record details page. The actual functions of the page and its panels are described on other help pages.

## Desktop

Tapping on the second of these buttons with the list icon (coloured green on this image), takes you to a page with three panels (as shown in the example below).

On the left is the *record summary list panel*, in the middle the *record details input panel* and on the right either the *location details panel*, *taxon details panel* or *metadata panel* (depending on your selection). The example below is showing the *location details panel*.

Tapping on any of these three buttons changes the panel displayed on the right-hand side, but leaves the record summary list and record details input panels unchanged.

## Mobile
<img src="/docs/images/nav-main-mobile.png" style="float: right; height: 30px; margin: 5px 10px" />On mobile, the main navigation bar at the bottom of the app has six buttons like the example shown on the right. Tapping on the second of these buttons with the list icon (coloured green on this image), takes you to a page that displays only the *record summary list panel* as shown below.

<img src="/docs/images/nav-details.png" style="float: right; height: 30px; margin: 5px 10px" />The extra button on this mobile view of the main navigation is shown on the right. Tapping on this button takes you to a *record details page* like that shown below. Note that this extra button is disabled until you first display the *record summary list panel* in order to select a record.

<img src="/docs/images/nav-details-mobile.png" style="float: right; height: 30px; margin: 5px 10px" />The mobile view of the records detail page is similar to the right-hand panel of the main desktop page that you reach when clicking on the second main navigation button (with the list icon) on a desktop. The main difference is that the top navigation buttons have increased from three to four. The extra button (the first one), shown on the right here, adds the allows you to switch to the *record details input panel* (which in the desktop view is always available as the middle panel).

## Emulating v1
<img src="/docs/images/nav-main-v1.png" style="float: right; height: 30px; margin: 5px 10px" />If you turn on the [*V1 emulation* option](/help.html?page=options), the interface is very much simplified. When emulating version 1, none of the panels used to edit records, view record details or manage CSV files are avalable and the main navigation bar is much simplified to reflect this, as shown on the right.

If you like, you can use this to give you the simplest interface in the field.
