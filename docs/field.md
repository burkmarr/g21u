# Using *g21u* in the field

[Help index](/help.html?page=index)

The underlying premise of Gilbert 21 is that making records in the field should consume as little time as possible and this is achieved by make recordings with voice notes which are tagged (via the file naming convention) with their location and date/time at the point they are made.

## Making a record

Once you have tapped the green microphone, it will turn red (and flash) and the device is recording your voice. Make the record, e.g. by saying the name of the organism you have found, and then tap the red microphone to stop recording. When you've done that successfully, the microphone image will turn green again. (Note that you can also complete a recording by turning off your phone's screen rather than tapping the red microphone.)

Note that when you first start the app or 'wake it up', the microphone will appear grey and you are prevented from making a record until the phone has obtained a location from its GPS location services.

## Abandoning a record

You can do that by clicking on the bin image which turns from grey to orange during a voice recording. Tapping the orange bin stops and discards the recording. (If you complete a record and wish to delete it, you can do that from the [record summary list panel](/help.html?page=record-list)).

## Audio signals
According to the [options](/help.html?page=options) you have set, you may also hear audio signals when you start and stop a voice recording or delete one that's in progress.

## Instant playback
There's nothing more frustrating than making an audio record in the field and then finding that it is inaudible when you are back at base, e.g. because of wind noise. To help avoid this, it is helpful to have *automatic playback* on - set it in the [options](/help.html?page=options). If this is switched on, then your recording is automatically played back to you immediately after you tap the red microphone to complete the recording and you can confirm that it is audible. If it isn't, you can record it again.

During istant playback, the microphone image is replaced by a flashing red speaker image and you can stop the playback before it is finished by tapping on the red speaker.

## Additional info
If the microphone appears grey when you first go to this screen, it is because the app hasn't yet retrieved a GPS location and you won't be able to make a record until it turns green. If this occurs it should only last a second or two.

<img src="/docs/images/gps-green.png" style="float: right; width:40px" />You may notice the little geolocation image (between the accuracy and altitude) ocassionally flashing green. It does this whenever an updated geolocation is recieved from your devices location services. The grid reference (and latitude/longitude) of the last retrieved location are always shown on the field recording screen and below this is the current accuracy being reported by the location services. When you first go to the screen, you may notice the reported accuracy improving (i.e. the number drops) and sometimes you may want to wait a few seconds for the accuracy to get to a reasonable level before making your record.

(Note that the altitude provided by your devices location services is also reported, but this is derived from GPS which may not be very accurate.)
