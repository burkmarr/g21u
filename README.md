# Gilbert 21 universal
Gilbert 21 universal is a progressive web app (PWA) and successor to the [Gilbert 21 Android app](https://github.com/burkmarr/G21App). The Android app has not been developed for some time and is no longer functional on recent releases of Android.

This app uses [PWA technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) to provide practically the same functionality as the old Android app but with the advantage that it is easier to develop and deploy. It can also be used on devices other than those running Android (e.g. iPhone).

The app also replaces some of the functionality of the desktop app so that all the work required to produce CSVs of biological records suitable for upload into applications such as [iRecord](https://irecord.org.uk/) can be done within this one app which runs both on mobile and desktop devices. Thus *Gilbert 21 universal* replaces both the Giblert 21 desktop application and the Android app.

The files generated by this app have the same format as those produced by the previous Android app and can therefore be used with the [Gilbert 21 desktop application](https://github.com/burkmarr/Gilbert21) in exactly the same way.
